# Kernel modules for character device driver

## Overview
This project includes various driver codes designed for different processing environments. It is structured into three main parts:


## Part 1: Uniprocessing Environment
This section contains the driver code specifically tailored for a uniprocessing environment. Here, tasks are managed and executed on a single processor.

## Part 2: Multiprocessing Environment
In this part, the driver code is designed for a multiprocessing environment. It demonstrates how to efficiently handle tasks across multiple processors to enhance performance and speed.

## Part 3: Multithreading Environment
This final part includes the driver code for a multithreading environment. It focuses on handling concurrent tasks within a single or multiple processors using threads.
